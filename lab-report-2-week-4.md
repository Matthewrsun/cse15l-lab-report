# Week 4 Lab Report: MarkdownParse.java

In this Lab, I looked at the MarkdownParse.java file, which reads markdown files and returns the links in the file in brackets, separated by commas. This code was started by Professor Joe, and my task was to fix bugs that were found in the file.

The starter code looked like this, and worked correctly for the given markdown file:

The first bug my group tested was a markdown file where additional text came after a link.
