# **Week 2 Lab Report**

## **Installing VSCode**

To install VSCode, visit the Visual Studio Code website at [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Pick the version for your operating system, and once you finish downloading VSCode, run the program. A window should appear like the one below:

## **Remotely Connecting**

The next step is to be able to connect to a remote server. For this, we're going to use a program called OpenSSH, which can be downloaded here: [OpenSSH Install Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). After this, you can login to the remote ieng6 server using your unique student account, which can be found here: [UCSD Account Finder](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). You can also find and change your account's password there too.

Now, you are able to login to a remote server using the VSCode terminal. Open up a terminal and run this code:

`$ ssh cs15lwi22ahf@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Don't forget to replace the letters after "wi22" with your personal account! Enter your password and you should be in!

## **Trying Some Commands**

Once you're in, you can try using some commands in the server. Some such commands include:

```
cd ~
cd
ls
ls -lat
ls -a
```

Here is an example, where I ran the command `ls -a`.

## **Moving Files with scp**

A command we are going to use now is `scp`, which copies a file from the client (the device you're using) onto the server. This command is run from the client. In my example, I used a file called WhereAmI.java. The command I used was this:

`scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22ahf@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

![scp1](LabPics/Lab1-4.png)

A prompt will pop up asking for your password, similar to when you were logging in, and after you enter your password, you should be able to see that your file has been copied over. Now, you will be able to find the file in the server directory.

## **Setting an SSH Key**

Not bad so far, right? However, it would be nice to be able to do all these things without needing to enter in your password every time you do something. So, it's time to set up an SSH key. This creates a key on both your client and the server that contains your password so that you don't need to enter it when logging in. Here is some convenient code that Professor Joe has graciously provided us with:

```
# on client (your computer)
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jZaZH6fI8E2I1D35hnvGeBePQ4ELOf2Ge+G0XknoXp0 joe@Joes-Mac-mini.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|                 |
|       . . + .   |
|      . . B o .  |
|     . . B * +.. |
|      o S = *.B. |
|       = = O.*.*+|
|        + * *.BE+|
|           +.+.o |
|             ..  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

If you are using Windows, there are extra steps you need to take before you have finished setting up your SSH key. The instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation). Don't forget to replace the code with your own username and directory!

Once you've finished setting up your SSH Key, you should be able to use `ssh` and `scp` without needing to enter in your password!

## **Optimizing Remote Running**

Believe it or not, this process can be made even more streamlined! For example, commands can be put at the end of your ssh command:

`ssh cs15lwi22ahf@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"`

This will login to the server, run the command, and then exit the server.

![sshkey and command](LabPics/Lab1-6.png)

In addition, you can run multiple commands, separating them with semicolons:

`cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI`

Another easy way to optimize running your code is by using shortcuts that reduce the number of keystrokes needed to run your code.

For example, in the image above, I ran `ssh cs15lwi22ahf@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"`. It's only one line of code, but it takes an entire 36 keystrokes, 39 if you count the `ctrl` input as well!

Now, the first time you type in the code, you will need to type out the entire line. However, the next time you want to run the same code, you can simply use the up arrow, â†‘. This copies the last command you ran onto the terminal, and if you press the up arrow again it takes the command that ran before it.

With this method, you can cut down your keystrokes from 39 imputs to only 2 or 3, if you ran code before it.

A more common example is compiling and running code. For this, you use 2 commands, one to compile and one to run. You can use the method of putting them in the same line, separated by a semicolon to make the process require only one line. To go further, after you edit your code, you simply need to press the up arrow to instantly bring up the command line again, cutting your keystrokes by about half!

## **This is the end!**

Well, that's all there is to this lab report. I hope this was helpful and I wish you luck on your computer programming adventure!
